# Introduction


ALT TITLE FOR BMJ: "The metabolic requirements and potential risk of injury with running at superhuman speed: A case study of Barry Allen"

Humans have long been interested in running as fast as possible. The ancient Olympic Games included various iterations of foot faces ***[refs]*** to determine who was the fastest, and this style of race (e.g. 100m sprint) remain one of the premier events on the track and field calendar within the modern Olympic Games.


Understanding how the peak of human ability when it comes to speed has also been a focus of scientific endeavours ***[refs]***

Einmahl and Smeets proposed the fastest times achievable for men and women in the 100-metre sprint at 9.51 and 10.33 seconds, respectively 



The interest in human running provides a teaching platform...


First and foremost, this work aims to predict the neuromechanical behaviour of sprinting at superhuman speeds, as depicted notably by the comic book character 'The Flash.' The secondary, but perhaps more notable, aims of this work are to: (i) provide open-source code examples that leverage new tools (i.e. OpenSim Moco) to adapt musculoskeletal models and produce simulations of human running; and (ii) provide a fun and accessible dataset for communicating complex biomechanical concepts and approaches in a relatable format for young (and maybe old too) students.


# Methodology


## Sub-Heading


The maximum speed of The Flash has never really been established. The ability to travel through time ***[refs???]***, however, is a potential indication that the speed of light is reachable... 

This sort of speed is perhaps beyond the scope of this work. Nonetheless, it is clear that The Flash can run at the speed of sound --- there are numerous examples ***[refs???]*** of the various iterations of The Flash producing sonic booms in comics...
--- Speed of sound = 343 m/s


Visuals of The Flash ***[in comics]refs???]*** appear to indicate that he maintains a relatively typical running gait. Given this, a low-weight tracking criterion was maintained in predictive simulations as a guide for maintaining this typical running pattern. 


Activation dynamics switched off --- no electromechanical delay...


Muscle contraction velocity --- increased...
From Weyand et al. --- "First, muscle fibers with more rapid contractile kinetics (34) may allow greater ground forces to be applied during the progressively shorter periods of foot-ground contact that sprinting at faster speeds requires. How fast might these faster muscle fibers allow humans to run?"

# Discussion


Biological limits on musclar force production in Weyand et al. --- proposes that humans can't produce maximal force during the short time period of stance due to muscular factors like EMD, activation dynamics etc. --- did the simulations of the current work and adaptations to the model allow this...? Extensor muscles in particular...

Weyand et al. also proposes that boucning gaits involve a trade-off between the magnitude of ground forces applied and the step frequencies that can be attained as foot-ground contact periods become shorter at progressively faster speeds. What was the trade-off betweens tep frequency and peak force here?



While obvious, it remains important to flag that the models used and simulations created in this work do not represent real-world studies of human movement. 

In no way does this work suggest that humans could ever produce...

Let's be real â€” unless lightning strikes and gives someone superpowers, the findings from this work have no practical implications for human sprinting. The code and analyses used herein, however, provide a framework for others to follow for using predictive simulations and direct collocation to potentially investigate realistic outcomes for improving human sprinting. This includes adjusting muscle parameters in a manner that may reflect physical training, or using predictive methods to investigate changes in technique that may lead to faster sprinting speed (e.g. like Nick's paper) ...

Weyand et al. --- "Consequently, human running speeds in excess of 50 km/h are likely to be limited to the realms of science fiction and, not inconceivably, gene doping."

Similarly, this paper may provide an interesting platform to discuss the use of predictive simulation in biomechanics to a young group. While noted that adults can enjoy comic books too, an amusing example with popular culture references may be a more excitable proposition and teaching opportunity to employ with  budding biomechanists when delving into predictive simulations and direct collocation...


Consider part of the discussion to reflect on the trials of generating simulations...
